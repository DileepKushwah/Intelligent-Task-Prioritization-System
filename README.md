# Intelligent-Task-Prioritization-System
Smart Task Analyzer is an intelligent task-management system that analyzes tasks, evaluates urgency, importance, dependencies, and effort, and produces optimized task-prioritization using multiple strategies. It includes:
✔️ Task scoring engine
✔️ Eisenhower matrix
✔️ Dependency graph
✔️ Strategy-based ranking
✔️ ML-style self-learning feedback loop
✔️ Full frontend + backend implementation
✔️ Unit tests (Django)
✔️ Clean and user-friendly UI


#Tech Stack
Backend
Python
Django REST Framework
Custom scoring algorithms
Feedback-based learning system
Unit tests (pytest/Django)

#Frontend
HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS
Responsive dashboard UI
Modal-based create/edit tasks
Local state management
Dependency visualization (vis.js)


#Features Implemented
Task Input Module
Title
Due date
Estimated hours
Importance (1–10)
Dependencies (checkbox UI)

#Add tasks with:
Edit and Delete tasks
Clear all tasks
Validations & confirmations included

#Analysis API
Implements the required scoring system:

Metric	                Description
Urgency               	Based on due date proximity
Importance	            User-selected (1–10)
Effort Score	          Inverse of hours required
Dependency Score	      Number of tasks depending on this task
Final score = weighted combination depending on strategy:

Smart balance
Fastest wins
High impact
Deadline driven


#Dependency Graph
Visual graph of task dependencies
Cycle detection
Highlights cyclic tasks in red
Built using vis.js

#Priority Matrix (Eisenhower Model)
Tasks categorized into:

1.Urgent + Important — Do First
2.Urgent + Not Important — Delegate
3.Not Urgent + Important — Schedule
4.Not Urgent + Not Important — Eliminate

#Suggestion Engine
Returns Top 3 tasks based on score.


#Learning System (Bonus Feature)
Records user feedback ("helpful" / "not helpful")
Adjusts internal scoring weights
Stored persistently in learning_weights.json
Makes system smarter over time

#Unit Testing (Bonus Feature)
6+ Django tests included:

Urgency calculation
Dependency handling
Score calculation
Strategy variation tests
API endpoint correctness
Feedback learning updates

#How to Run the Project

1. Backend Setup
cd backend
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver

Backend runs at:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/

2. Frontend Setup
Simply open:

frontend/index.html
in your browser.

No frameworks needed.

 API Endpoints (as required)
Method	    Endpoint	             Purpose
POST	      /api/tasks/analyze/	   Scores & ranks tasks
POST	      /api/tasks/suggest/	   Returns top 3 tasks
POST	      /api/tasks/graph/	     Dependency graph data
POST	      /api/tasks/feedback/	 Learning system

All endpoints fully implemented & tested.
